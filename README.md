Leaked Linux.Mirai Source Code for Research/IoC Development Purposes

Uploaded for research purposes and so we can develop IoC's and such.

See "post.txt" (transcribed in [post.md](post.md)) for the post in which it
leaks, if you want to know how it is all set up and the likes.

Be careful - theres bins in there that probably connect back to heckforamz skids
bullshit.
